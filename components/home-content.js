                I am the Mellow Cobra, a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer formally known as Grayson Dubois.
                My main areas of interest are Reactive Web Applications, Machine Learning, and Artificial Neural
                Networks. My philosophy is that software is a tool that is meant to be used to help the greater
                community. I hold to the belief that technology is not great in and of itself, but it is what technology
                can achieve that is awe-inspiring and impressive.

                I am an Associate Application Engineer at <a href="https://hcahealthcare.com/">HCA</a>. My work deals
                with providing support and development of applications for Enterprise Integration and Mobility
                Services. I have developed applications in iOS, as well as web applications using Node.js, Vue.js,
                and an in-house, open-source JavaScript framework called
                <a href="https://github.com/ohmubus/cognition-framework">Cognition.js</a>.

                I graduated with Honors from <a href="https://www.mtsu.edu">Middle Tennessee State University</a> in
                2017 with a B.S. in Computer Science. My undergraduate research dealt with using new methods of
                representing concepts called Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR) in artificial neural networks
                that mimic human working memory systems. I worked under the guidance of
                <a href="https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~jphillips">Dr. Joshua L. Phillips</a> to design and incorporate my own
                <a href="https://g-dubois.github.io/Holographic-Reduced-Representation-Engine/">Holographic Reduced
                Representation Engine</a> into his <a href="https://github.com/jlphillipsphd/wmtk"> Working Memory
                toolkit</a>, a library written in ANSI C++ designed to allow researchers to write simulations of
                learning tasks using ANNs modeled after working memory.
